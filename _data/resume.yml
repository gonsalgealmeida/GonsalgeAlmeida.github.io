    <p style="text-align: justify;">Jordan has earned degrees from the University of Florida and Louisiana State
    University. Before accepting a position in a data science training program, he 
    performed analyses of plasma thrusters, nuclear reactors, and materials. Through 
    his role as an accountant and his business leadership courses, he has gained industry 
    perspectives which complement his academic training. In addition, he has worked as a 
    public relations officer, a peer mentor, and a teacher which, along with his research and
    leadership presentations have trained him to speak effectively to any audience.</p>

      Jordan worked with Dr. Leigh Winfrey doing space nuclear propulsion
      research on a plasma microthruster and performed computational analysis on reactor 
      criticality with Dr. Andreas Enqvist
      
    highlights:
      - "Rework codes to solve for propulsive properties of plasma flow within thruster"
      - "Using supercomputer nodes, computationally analyze nuclear reactor core data"

    summary: >
      As Jordan was a student, his job title was 'Accounting Intern'; however, after the first year,
      the full-time accountant left and he ended up taking over her role entirely. After the initial
      initial finances meeting with the Bursar's Office, Jordan saw inefficiencies in the current 
      accounting system and built a new one from scratch -- it replaced the office's spreadsheets as well
      as those used by the Bursar's Office.
      
    highlights:
      - "Handled approximately $1,000,000 annually in small daily charges spread across five grants"
      - "Rebuilt accounting system and trained data entry personnel on its use"

    summary: >
      As these projects were computational, this time was largely spent working with the codes 
      and computing systems. Jordan assisted in setting up new nodes in a cluster and did a 
      detailed analysis of the computational logic used in the group's codes in addition to presenting
      to the experimental group and occassionally to undergraduates new to the field.
      
    highlights:
      - "Computationally analyze materials via iterative methods to determine electric and magnetic properties"
      - "Compare theoretical data with the results from the experimental lab under Dr. John DiTusa"
