# Jordan Ball: Data Scientist

This repository contains the back-end of my personal website which can be found [here](https://jballdata.github.io/).

On the site, you can read about me, view or download my resume, see a selected list of projects I have done, or read some blog posts (only one so far, though I
am halfway through a second one explaining a systematic approach to new machine learning problems).

The foundation of this site is a jekyll theme called 'Hydejack'. At the request of the creators, I build locally and then push the site to github, so many of the
build documents are not in this repository.
