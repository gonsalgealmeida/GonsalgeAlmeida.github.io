title: About Jordan

<p style="text-align: justify;"> One year ago, I was in the process of getting Ph.D.s in nuclear engineering and
aerospace engineering while researching space nuclear propulsion. Though my lab's 
work was progressing well, the lab was defunded, and I began to look for other 
opportunities.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> I found a want ad for a data scientist position-- I had never heard of the field,
so I read up on it. After I had a chance to research the role, I found it to be 
exactly what I was looking for! Data science allows for constant critical thinking
and logical problem solving which is what drew me into scientific fields in the 
first place.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As I looked more into the idea of data science, I was offered positions at other 
top universities to complete my education. While they were excellent positions, 
I chose to see my situation as an opportunity to reevaluate where I was going. 
Then, my department director sent me an email recommending I apply for The Data 
Incubator (TDI) which trains people with academic backgrounds to become data 
scientists in an industry setting. The program has a 2% acceptance rate, but I 
decided to dedicate myself to the idea of becoming a data scientist and go through
the several rounds of the application process.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After a survey of skills, a series of technical challenges, and a project proposal 
defense, I got in to TDI! Now I am a reformed space nuclear propulsion scientist 
with a background in finance, leadership, risk assessment, and quantitative analysis 
looking for roles in Data Science. </p>
